# Malaria_Cell_Classification_KNIME
Malaria Cell Image Classification using KNIME typically involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Obtain a dataset of malaria cell images. A common dataset used for this task is the "Malaria Cell Images Dataset," which is available from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website or other repositories.
   - Preprocess the images to standardize their size, format, and resolution. You may also apply image augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase the diversity of your dataset and improve the model's robustness.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Convert the raw images into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Commonly used techniques include extracting features from the images using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception.

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Divide your dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

4. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Select a suitable machine learning or deep learning model for image classification, such as CNNs. KNIME offers various pre-implemented models, or you can create custom models using KNIME's machine-learning nodes.
   - Train the chosen model using the training set and validate it with the validation set. Adjust hyperparameters and model architecture as needed to achieve better performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - After training the model, evaluate its performance using the test set. Common evaluation metrics for image classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Deployment and Prediction**:
   - Once the model is trained and evaluated satisfactorily, you can deploy it to make predictions on new, unseen malaria cell images.
